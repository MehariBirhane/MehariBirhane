## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Birhane Mehari

I'm a Computer Science major at Wright State University with a strong passion for software development, technology, and problem solving.

I have experience in:
- C++ and Java
- Database Systems SQL

  I'm currently working on two projects Bookshelf Library System and Cafe Management System.

**Bookshelf Library System**

  The Bookshelf Library System is a Java and Spring Boot application designed to manage library operations efficiently.  
It enables users to add, update, delete, and search for books, as well as track borrowing and returning records through a user-friendly backend.

**Cafe Management System**

The CafÃ© Management System is a full-stack Java application built with Spring Boot and MySQL to automate cafÃ© operations.  
It manages menus, customer orders, billing, and sales reports, helping improve efficiency and reduce manual work.
